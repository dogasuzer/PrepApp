<p align="left"> 
PrepApp is a mobile application developed to assist users in preparing and organizing their cooking recipes. The app offers features such as creating and managing recipes, tracking recipe progress, and exploring a variety of recipes shared by other users. PrepApp utilizes a range of technologies and stacks to deliver a robust and user-friendly experience. Here are the techs and stacks used in PrepApp:

<h3 align="left">Front-end:</h3>
<p align="left"> On the front-end, I employed React Native, a JavaScript framework for building mobile applications. With React Native, I was able to develop a mobile interface that offers intuitive recipe creation and management functionalities. I also implemented Redux as a state management library to effectively manage the application state, ensuring smooth data flow and updates across different screens. To handle screen transitions and navigation within the app, I integrated React Navigation, which provided a seamless and intuitive navigation experience.

<h3 align="left">Backend:</h3>
<p align="left"> 
I chose to leverage AWS Amplify, a powerful development platform for building cloud-powered applications. By using AWS Amplify, I could easily integrate my app with various AWS services. I utilized AWS Lambda, a serverless compute service, to run backend code in response to events, enabling efficient and scalable processing. With AWS AppSync, a managed service for GraphQL APIs, I simplified the development of my app's API layer, making it easier to retrieve and manage data efficiently. To store and retrieve structured data, I employed Amazon DynamoDB, a NoSQL database service.

<h3 align="left">APIs and Libraries:</h3>
<p align="left"> 
In terms of APIs and libraries, I implemented GraphQL as a query language for my APIs. This allowed me to efficiently retrieve and manage recipe data, optimizing performance and reducing data transfer overhead. I relied on Axios, a popular JavaScript library, to make HTTP requests to external APIs, enabling seamless integration with external services and data sources.
